# CloudPedia WHMCS Client Area Theme

This repository contains the source code for the WHMCS client area system and order form themes for [Portal CloudPedia](https://portal.cloudpedia.id).

## Overview

The project aims to create a modern, responsive, and user-friendly client area for WHMCS, based on the designs provided by the CloudPedia team. This theme will replace the default WHMCS themes to provide a branded and improved user experience.

## Development

This project uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for frontend development.
